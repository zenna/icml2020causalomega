# Issues:
# 1. unbound should be parameterized 
# 2. Don't want to recompute keys
# 3. gradient

# Let me summarize the issues with gradient
# If we have purely functional interface, which just returns gradient
# The signature doesn't quite work
# I can't define a generic function gradient(::RandVar, ::Array{Array}, ::GradAlg)
# Because we would need to know how to go from the array{array} to the omega
# One option is to have a kind of structure

# Inefficiencies
# dots.  but better to leave them in and wait

# Opti1ons
# 1. Return tagged omegas
# 2. Tag then untag when putting n vector 
# -- untag everything> what if its already tagged with stuff we dont want to get rid of
# 3. Tag at individual callsites
#  -- bit messier, tagging is slow
