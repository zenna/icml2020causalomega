# # In this experiment we use the Lotka-Volterra model for counterfactual reasoning about population dynamics.
# # The Lotka-Volterra model is a pair of differential equations which represent interacting populations of predators (e.g. wolves) and prey (e.g. rabbits):

# # ```math
# # {\frac {dx}{dt}} =\alpha x-\beta xy \;\;\;\;\;\;
# # {\frac {dy}{dt}} =\delta xy-\gamma y
# # ```

# # where $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ represents the prey and predator  respectively.
# # Parameters $\alpha, \beta, \delta$ and $\gamma$ are positive constants which represent growth rates.

# # Suppose that after observing for 10$ days until `t_now = 20`, we discover that  the rabbit population is unsustainably high.
# # We want to ask counterfactual questions: how would an intervention now affect the future; had we intervened in this past, could we have avoided this situation? 

# # ### The prior: differential equations model for population dynamics

# # lotka_volterra represents dynamics of wolves and rabbit populations over time
# function lotka_volterra(du, u, p, t)
#   x, y = u    # x, y = u[1], u]2] = prey. predator
#   α, β, δ, γ = p
#   du[1] = dx = α*x - β*x*y
#   du[2] = dy = -δ*y + γ*x*y
# end

# # Initial conditions of dynamical system are uniformly distributed
# u0 = uniform(0.5, 1.5, (2,))

# # At `t_now` we observe the populations
# t_now = 20.0

# # The time span of the ODE integration is from 0 to `t_now`.  We make it a constant random variable to be easily intervenable
# tspan = constant((0.0, t_now))

# # Prior over Lotka-Volterra parameters
# p = ciid(ω -> [uniform(ω, 1.3, 1.7), uniform(ω, 0.7, 1.3), uniform(ω, 2.7, 3.3), uniform(ω, 0.7, 1.3)])

# # A distribution over simulation problems and solutions
# prob = ciid(ω -> ODEProblem(lotka_volterra, u0(ω), tspan(ω), p(ω)))
# sol = lift(solve)(prob)

# # Plot four samples of time series from the prior
# plotts(sol...; kwargs...) = plot(sol..., label = ["rabbits" "wolves"]; kwargs...)
# #nb plot(plotts(rand(sol)), plotts(rand(sol)), plotts(rand(sol)), plotts(rand(sol)), layout = (2, 2))

# # ### Counter-factual model (a random random variable over `solve(ODEProblem...))`
# "Generate a counterfatual model"
# function gencf(; affect! = integrator -> integrator.u[2] /= 2.0,
#                  t_int = uniform(tspan[1], tspan[2]/2.0),
#                  tspan = tspan)
#   condition = ciid(ω -> (u, t, integrator) -> t == t_int(ω))
#   cb = DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!)
#   # Solution to differential equation with intervention
#   sol_int = ciid(ω -> solve(ODEProblem(lotka_volterra, u0(ω), tspan(ω), p(ω)),
#                             EM(),
#                             callback = DiscreteCallback(condition(ω), affect!),
#                             tstops = t_int(ω)))

# # ### Effect of (observed too many rabbits)

# "Total number of rabbits"
# function totalrabbits_(ω; ndays = 10)
#   sol_ = sol(ω)
#   n = length(sol_)
#   rabbits = [sol_[i][1] for i = (n - ndays):n]
#   sum(rabbits)
# end

# # `totalrabbits` is a random variable whose values depends on the prior of the ODE 
# totalrabbits = ciid(totalrabbits_)

# # There are too many rabbits if sum is 5 for previous ndays = 10
# toomanyrabbits = totalrabbits ==ₛ 5.0

# # Next, we examine the effect of action.  According to Pearl, action means intervening on the random variable being observed, which does not affect the past
# # In particular, if we were to increase the predator population by 5 at t_now, would the rabbit population be reduced?

# # Now we construct an intervened model where the we add 1.0 to the number of rabbits (prey)
# sol_inc_wolves = gencf(; affect! = integrator -> integrator.u[2] += 5.0,
#                       t_int = constant(t_now),

# # ### Counter Factual
# # Next, we consider the counterfactual: had we made an intervention at some previous time `t < t_now`, would the rabbit population have been less than it actually was over the last 10 days?
# # First we choose a random intervention time: `t_int`
# t_int = uniform(tspan[1], tspan[2]/2.0)

# # Construct the model that increases the number of predators at some time in the past
# sol_inc_pred_past = gencf(; t_int = t_int,
#                             affect! = integrator -> integrator.u[2] += 2.0)

# sol_cull_prey_past = gencf(; t_int = t_int,

# # Choosing a fixed time to intervene (e.g. $t = 5$)  is likely undesirable because it corresponds to an arbitrary (i.e.: parameter dependent) point in the predator-prey cycle.
# # Instead, the following snippet selects the intervention dynamically as a function of values in the non-intervened world.
# # `maxindex` is an auxilliary function which selects the index of the largest value and hence \texttt{tmostwolves} is a random variable over such values.
